# Parallel_NaiveBayes
EE451 Final Project
Project members: Jiuchang Zhang, Jingwen Gong

We are optimizing naive bayesian learning by applying different parallel techniques including Pthread, MPI, OpenMP. We will then analyze the results. We used naive bayesian learning to classify handwritten digit from 0 to 9. We used the data set from MNIST database.
